## Goal ##

View UDP packets containing messages packed using [Google Protocol Buffers](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf) in [Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org) (or Ethereal).

## Approach ##

If the .proto file is not available, a generic wireshark dissector plugin displays messages as "field id: value" pairs.

If the .proto file is available, a custom wireshark dissector plugin displays messages as "field name: value" pairs.

The wireshark dissectors simply use the unpacking code present in the base libprotobuf and that generated by protoc (when the .proto file is available).

Detailed information can be found in the [README](http://protobuf-wireshark.googlecode.com/files/README-0.4.txt).

## Screenshot ##

The following screenshot shows how packets containing addressbook messages (from the example in Google Protocol Buffers package) are displayed in Wireshark.
